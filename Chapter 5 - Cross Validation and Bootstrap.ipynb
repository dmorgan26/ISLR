Interestingly, these are somewhat different from the estimates obtained using the bootstrap. Does this indicate a problem with the bootstrap? In fact, it suggests the opposite. Recall that the standard formulas given in Eqauation(3.8) rely on certain assumptions. For example, they depend on the unknown paramater Ï^2, the noise variance. We then estimate Ï^2 using the RSS. Now although the formula for the standard errors do not rely on the linear model being correct, the estimate for Ï^2 does. We see in figure 3.8 (page 105)  that there is a non-linear relationship in the data, and so the residuals from a linear fit will be inflated, and so will Ï^2. Secondly, the standard formulas assume (somewhat unrealistically) that the xi are fixed, and all the variability comes from the variation in the errors ei. The bootstrap approach does not rely on any of these assumptions, and so it is likely giving a more accurate estimate of the standard errors of B^0 and B^1 than is the summary() function.\n",
